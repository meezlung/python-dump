# python-dump

## Codewars and CS Circle
Just a python code dump i used in Codewars, CS Circle - University of Waterloo, etc.

## DCS Bootcamp Folder
This is some of the notes about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that I gathered in the Freshie Introduction Bootcamp in UPD Department of Computer Science. I included some of the exercises we did and I tried to integrate more such as Pygame.
 - OOP Notes.py (Just some notes, don't run)
 - Add Real and Imaginary Numbers.py (based on Kuya Basti's coding)
 - Do the Rest (We're instructed to make a function that acts like it multiplies two binomial equations, since it involves one real and one imaginary number.)
 - Collision.py (based on Kuya Basti's coding)
 - Integrating Collision in Pygame.py (I integrated Pygame library in Kuya Basti's Code and added two rectangles two visualize how disjoint works)

## Big-O Notation
Random python codes for testing different Big-O Notations
